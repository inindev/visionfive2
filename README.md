#### *Stock Ubuntu riscv64 Linux for the StarFive VisionFive 2*

This stock Ubuntu riscv64 Linux image is built directly from official ports packages using the Debian [debootstrap](https://packages.ubuntu.com/mantic/debootstrap) utility.

Being an unmodified [ubuntu-ports](http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/dists/mantic/main/binary-riscv64/) build, patches are directory available from the Ubuntu repos using the stock **apt** package manager.

If you want to run out-of-the-box Ubuntu Linux on your StarFive VisionFive 2 riscv64 device, this is the way to do it.
